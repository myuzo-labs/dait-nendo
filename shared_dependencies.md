Based on the structure of the project, the shared dependencies could be:

1. **Smart Contract Interfaces**: Both `/contracts/cosmos` and `/contracts/ethereum` would likely share common interfaces or abstract contracts that define the methods and events for the smart contracts.

2. **Federated Learning Interfaces**: The `/federated_learning/client`, `/federated_learning/server`, and `/federated_learning/model` would likely share common interfaces or classes that define the structure of the federated learning model and the methods for training and updating the model.

3. **IPFS Interfaces**: The `/ipfs/data_management` and `/ipfs/encryption` would likely share common interfaces or classes that define the methods for encrypting, storing, and retrieving data from IPFS.

4. **Nendo Integration Interfaces**: The `/nendo_integration/api`, `/nendo_integration/ui`, and `/nendo_integration/utils` would likely share common interfaces or classes that define the methods for interacting with the Nendo platform.

5. **Test Interfaces**: The `/tests/contracts` and `/tests/federated_learning` would likely share common interfaces or classes that define the methods for testing the smart contracts and federated learning functionality.

6. **Script Variables**: The `/scripts/setup.sh` and `/scripts/deploy.sh` would likely share environment variables or configuration settings that define the parameters for setting up and deploying the application.

7. **Documentation**: The `/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` and `/docs/README.md` would likely share common formatting or style guidelines for writing and updating the documentation.

8. **Package Dependencies**: The `package.json` file would contain the list of all the dependencies required by the project, which would be shared across all the other files in the project.

9. **License**: The `LICENSE` file would define the terms under which the project can be used, which would apply to all the other files in the project.

10. **Gitignore**: The `.gitignore` file would specify the files and directories that should be ignored by Git, which would apply to all the other files in the project.
